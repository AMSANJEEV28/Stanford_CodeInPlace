# My Code in Place Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my repository documenting my learning journey through Code in Place! This repository contains my weekly assignment code and section meet assignments, organized into week-wise folders. Code in Place is a free introductory programming course that focuses on teaching Python, based on the material from Stanford University's CS106A course.

## What I'll Gain

By engaging in Code in Place, I aim to enhance my programming skills and deepen my understanding of Python. While I already have some programming experience, this course provides a structured learning path and valuable resources to further develop my proficiency.

## Repository Structure

- `Week1/`, `Week2/`, ... : Each week has a dedicated folder containing the code for the assignments completed during that week.
- `section_meet_assignments/`: This directory holds the assignments related to the section meet sessions.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of my learning journey and the repository structure.

I'm excited to embrace this learning opportunity and continue building my programming skills with Code in Place. Through this repository, I aim to showcase my progress and the knowledge gained throughout the course.

Let's embark on this coding adventure together!
